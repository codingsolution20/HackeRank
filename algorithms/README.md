# Algorithms

In computer science, an algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable
instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or to perform a computation. Algorithms are
always unambiguous and are used as specifications for performing calculations, data processing,
automated reasoning, and other tasks.

As an effective method, an algorithm can be expressed within a finite amount of space and time,
and in a well-defined formal language for calculating a function. Starting from an initial state
and initial input (perhaps empty), the instructions describe a computation that, when executed,
proceeds through a finite number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing "output"
and terminating at a final ending state. The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily
deterministic; some algorithms, known as randomized algorithms, incorporate random input.
