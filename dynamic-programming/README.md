# Dynamic programming

Dynamic programming refers to simplifying a complicated problem by breaking it down into simpler
sub-problems in a recursive manner. While some decision problems cannot be taken apart this way,
decisions that span several points in time do often break apart recursively. Likewise, in computer
science, if a problem can be solved optimally by breaking it into sub-problems and then recursively
finding the optimal solutions to the sub-problems, then it is said to have optimal substructure.

If sub-problems can be nested recursively inside larger problems, so that dynamic programming methods
are applicable, then there is a relation between the value of the larger problem and the values of
the sub-problems. In the optimization literature this relationship is called the Bellman equation.
