# C

C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming,
lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. By design, C provides constructs
that map efficiently to typical machine instructions. It has found lasting use in applications previously
coded in assembly language. Such applications include operating systems and various application software
for computers architectures that range from supercomputers to PLCs and embedded systems.

A successor to the programming language B, C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie
between 1972 and 1973 to construct utilities running on Unix. It was applied to re-implementing the
kernel of the Unix operating system. During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity. It has become
one of the most widely used programming languages, with C compilers from various vendors available for
the majority of existing computer architectures and operating systems. C has been standardized by the
ANSI since 1989 (ANSI C) and by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).
